physicists to conceptualize and develop a robust communications operations analysis SaaS application.","Designed and implemented several microservices using Java (Quarkus) for the backend, PostgreSQL for databases, Redis for caching and event-based messaging, and Amazon S3 for object storage.","Enhanced the security and user experience of our microservice architecture by integrating OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication using Keycloak and the companyâ€™s existing Single Sign-On (SSO) infrastructure.","Streamlined multiple analysis workflows, significantly reducing runtime and improving efficiency.","Managed multiple Kubernetes deployments at scale, including creating Docker containers, Helm charts, automated application deployment with ArgoCD, and configuring the Istio service mesh.","Trained and deployed machine learning models with scikit-learn and TensorFlow (Python) to forecast the impact of weather conditions on communication reliability between assets.","Contributed to continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automating testing and deployment processes with GitLab CI.","Collaborated closely with stakeholders to gather requirements, identify challenges, and propose innovative solutions.","Participated in code reviews and provided constructive feedback to team members.","Assisted in numerous analysis studies, performing analyses for several satellite constellations, utilizing microservice architecture and developing ad hoc scripts to enhance and/or expand on software results."]},{"name":"Lockheed Martin
