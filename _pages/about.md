My name is Cole Sturza. I am currently a Software Engineer Intern at Lockheed Martin Space. Professionally, my interests are backend software development, DevOps, AI, machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, and operations research. Personally, I enjoy topics that are generally focused around math, computer science, economics, and/or political science (particularly computational social choice). I also enjoy playing soccer, skiing/snowboarding, and playing video games.
