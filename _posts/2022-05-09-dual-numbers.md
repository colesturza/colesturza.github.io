This post is a test.

Dual numbers are a expressions that take on the form $$a + b\epsilon$$, where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are real numbers, and $$\epsilon$$ is taken to satisfy $$\epsilon^{2} = 0$$. More formally, we can say that the set of all dual numbers is equal to

$$
\{a + b\epsilon \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \epsilon^{2} = 0, \epsilon \ne 0\} ~ .
